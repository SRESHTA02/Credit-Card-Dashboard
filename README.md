 TRUE(),
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
 "unknown"
)

IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
 TRUE(),

week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])

Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]

Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
 SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
 FILTER(
 ALL('public cc_detail'),
 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
))

Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
 SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
 FILTER(
